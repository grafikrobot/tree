[section TODO]

General:
* iterator<postorder> probably needs to be overloaded and to contain a bool indicating if we're
  dealing with "end" when we're at the root
* In most algorithms, calls to index(c) appear after a c.to_parent() operation, so for 
  increased effciency, we need a to_parent_return_index(c) function.
* Fix binary_tree_test (rotate)
* Apply all binary_tree_test cchecks also to fake_binary_tree in order to check if semantics
  are mapped properly.
* Subforest algorithms: with a first and last parameter (which, for binary tree based
  forests, should be passed through to the corresponding binary cursor algorithms.
* Do we need to_{left|right}most_ancestor?
* Do we need multiway and plain cursor "flavor" tags (for algorithms)?
* In case of forest cursor, is_leaf() should really be empty().
* Add algorithms for construction of a tree based on two ranges specifying its
  pre-/in-/postorder linearization (see Knuth).
* preorder_insert_cursor: hopefully easy to implement...
* Add checks for correspondence of concepts and archetypes!
* Re-do forest (again!).
  This seems to raise one issue, though: subtree algorithms operate on subtree root cursors,
  not ranges.
   (They might, however, work for "subforests". Consult Austern's segmented 
  iterators paper!)
  They also work for the important special case in which forest consists of only one
  subtree!
* Fix cursor_archetype. Currently, there's trouble eg with constructors.
* Remove a cursor's cursor, const_cursor, iterator and const_iterator typedefs?
  The latter two only make sense in a range algorithm context, where they might actually be
  useful. (The former two are just aliases for completeness' sake.)
* Make Order the last (instead of first) parameter in algorithms? That way, we could
  assume reasonable defaults while offering explicit choice (eg for size(), find(), 
  maybe even copy(): default to preorder).
* Implement descending_node; and corresponding cursor.
* Fix freestanding index() and members (esp. wrt cursor facade and adaptor!)
* Redo all that balance(==balanced_tree)/searcher stuff. Avoid redundancy, that is, make them both use 
  balanceRs for whatever they're up to, but don't make searcher depend on balance.
* Add a congruence check algorithm (compare shapes of subtrees; call it "similar()"?).
* Finish moving algorithm checks etc. to fake_binary_tree.
* Revisit binary_tree . Can it be usable for both balanced and forest trees and still be
  "light-weight" at the same time? Solution: Introduce an "inorder_optimised_binary_tree" 
  (with O(1) inorder first and last cursors, and possibly
  inorder insert and erase functions) for use with balancers, but without splice member functions.
  Iterators, however, have to go from both types of binary_tree.
* Rename node/nary.hpp back to node/binary.hpp (really? what about ternary), and cleanup.
* Extend and parametrize subtree tests (subtree root, subtree size).
* Clean up node/cursor/binary_tree implementation.
* Fix forest copy
* Fix cursor archetypes: *order copy checks don't compile
* Implement forest_tree::insert_above.
* Revisit namespaces.
* Move some of the secondary stuff to a util/ dir? Is that what they're used for?
* Think of a couple good examples (draw inspiration eg from Wikipedia: Tree traversal
  or CRLS) and include them in the docs. Maybe move some files from libs/test to
  example.
* Migrate to using Jamfile.v2 from Intrusive (already used in our libs/example dir)
* Add performance checks (to a libs/perf/ directory).
* Look into SOC 2008 projects dsearch (already using concepts from Boost.Tree) and 
  spacial_indexing (with tree classes of its own)
* Can't we really do without inorder_erase()?
* Check if Cursor(balanced_tree_iterator) really has no is_root member()! (BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT?)
* Revisit binary_tree inorder iterator functions
* Possibly sort out some more concepts, like trees with "downwards" or "upwards" insertion
  (insert()/insert_above()), trees with values only at the leaves (makes sense in combination
  with "upwards" insertion"), etc.
* Is it really a good idea to use InCursor::size_type for size(Cursor)?
  For a binary_cursor, a boolean size_type would be enough - but
  not for a subtree algorithm like this one. Maybe we need two different size_types for
  cursor - a "children" one for iterator compatibility and a "subtree" one for
  "larger scale".
* Use the example trees form Knuth as test example data.
* Write (internal/external?) adaptors for other tree libraries, as Kaspar Peeters' or
  Adobe's.
  * External: what would we need? next()/prior(), plus to_begin()/to_end()/to_parent(),
    deref, ...?
  * Compare to BGL: Is it possible to modify adapted graphs using graph semantics?
    If not, adaptation within the BGL would only map inspecting (read-only) functions.
    (Compare this again to container vs sequence; also look into graph concepts.)
    Finally, mind the implications for internal/external adaptation; they might be
    generalised, if the above assumption is true.
* Make algorithms work with empty subtrees.
  (Not necessarily! If that means a check for empty(), it's better to leave it to
  the user!)
* Investigate the lower_bound for search vs insert purposes problem.
* Take care of inorder begin() for binary_tree<int>.  
* Keep in mind it's not necessarily a good thing to have *order end() be the last element's
  right child. For inorder and postorder, it seems like the subtree root is a better choice.
  For preorder, things are pretty diffcult.
* Do a unit test that creates a random tree with a given number of elements. 
  Let the cursor based *order algorithms then copy its elements into linear structures 
  and compare these linear structures to an iterator-based *order traversal.
* Should const_cursor have cbegin(), cend() and cparent() members?
* have `erase()` operations return cursor/iterator instead of void (as in new STD)
* We might need still more binary_tree members for more efficient functions operating on
  ranges...
* `insert()` and `erase()` semantics need reworking. For instance, Proposal 23.X.4.1.4 §2 
  (and related for deletion and multiway tree insertion/deletion) are way too convoluted
  for a really basic operation. Still, it's important to consider special cases such as
  root nodes and fields of use such as `forest_trees`; but for the latter, something similar
  as inorder_insert might come in handy.
* Add (inorder-)threaded binary trees?? Are they useful? Can they be balanced?
  They'd surely be interesting for experimenting with algorithms!
* Start an RFC: what subtree algorithms should there be? In particular, of which of
  the STL's linear algorithms should there be a hierarchical version?

Testing:
* Re-merge algorithm tests into algorithm_test.cpp after they're all tidied up?
* Clean up binary_tree_test
* Re-organize traversal tests:
  * Verify algorithms to work
    * 1. with at least one tree filled with given data
    * 2. with an empty tree
  Minimize possible points of failure, ie always compare to pre-defined test data.

Testing tools:
* Possibly calculate *order positions from level order indices
  as of fake_binary_tree. Possibly change fake_binary_tree internal representation to a 
  vector<bool> with indices indicating the level order position (and also the value),
  and values indicating "empty or not".
  
Performance tests:
* Implement a real output cursor (if possible) and use copy(preorder(), ...) to build a new tree.
  Then, do some performance measurements comparing
  * Different *orders;
  * BOOST_RECURSIVE_ORDER_ALGORITHMS on and off;
  * cursor and iterator based algorithms (from Boost.Tree and the STL, respectively)
  Do these measurements also with algorithms other than copy.

Pre-release:
* Look into 
  * boost/graph/tree_traits.hpp
  * Matt Austern's segmented iterators paper (maybe relevant for level order algos).
* Make directory structure reflect namespaces and vice versa.
* Cleanup headers/ #include dependencies, whitespace, indentation.
* Run Boost Inspect.

Future: 
* Exception safety?
* Thread safety?
* Add cool constructors/assignment à la C++0x, ie (nested) parentheses or Boost.Assign.
* Do we need cursors that are not iterators, ie that provide to_begin() and to_end 
  (and possibly to_parent()) operations, but not operator++() and --?
* Optimise insert_cursor for use with binary_tree insert and copy ctor 
  (preorder copy; ideally, we can guarantee RAII for every single element)
  and clear/dtor (postorder for_each).
* Deprecate non-preorder insert cursors.
* Implement "flat" (sequential *order representation) trees (cf. Knuth, Fundamental Algorithms,
  pp. 348--351). Possibly useful for automated testing of "real" (binary, forest) trees.

Ask on the mailing list:

* (iterator) Can we get rid of the need to declare iterator_core_access a friend (as we're already 
  doing so with cursor_core_access, this should be enough).
* (property_map): any need for an extract_property_map?

Proposal:

* Can we just build the proposal from doxygen and quickbook parts?
* Change parity/parent complexity requirements at least for binary_tree::cursor? - See newsgroup thread.
* Change complexity requirements for * order end() to constant? We're using root(), and
  for postorder begin() - which is also root() - it's already constant. Then again, how much
  do we cater for "pathological" implementations (and not so pathological ones, like 
  threaded trees)?
* Write a cursor_facade, cursor_adaptor, ascending_cursor, root_tracking_cursor
  (and output_cursor_iterator_wrapper? etc.) proposal.
* Add a revision log:
 * Add to_parent() (replaces operator!()), to_begin() and to_end() descending cursor members.
 * Remove shoot(), size() (rationale for size(): see std::list::size() O(n) vs O(1) discussion,
   esp the Howard Hinnant comments, http://home.twcny.rr.com/hinnant/cpp_extensions/On_list_size.html )
 * Change some occurences of "vector" (oops) to the respective tree type.
 * cursor's begin(), end() and parent() members now only return cursor, same for const_cursor.
  (This somewhat breaks with container requirements, but it makes sense this way.)
* Add InputCursor requirements: binary cursor if it's a binary_tree member function, etc.
* Cursor validity after insertion/erasure/clearing
* Possibly rename ascending to hierarchy cursor? (because of other uses for ascending/cursors in a graph context)
* Remove operator* requirement? (for upward-growing trees with data only on the bottom level --- like B+trees)
* Refactor balancer section to map implementation 
	(balanced_tree template class using policies -- like red_black -- from namespace balancers)
* Add new metadata approach
* Add inorder_erase to balanced_tree requirements

Implementation:

* Implement remaining (binary_tree) balancers, augmentors
* Implement forest. Can its cursor type have an O(1) parent()?
* Implement nary_tree, multiway_tree, b_tree, b_star_tree
* Add tests for and rework
	* binary_tree: subtree insert; splice operations
	* red_black
	* searcher
* Concept checks.
* Interoperability with BGL algorithms.
* C++09: Add template typedefs (e.g. red_black_tree is balanced_tree<red_black_balancer, binary_tree>)

Documentation:

* Add images - there's quite a lot of public domain tree related stuff on Wikipedia!
  (acknowledge their authors).
* algorithms.qbk is rather pointless right now. Better use doygen for
  an algorithm group.
* Add a rationale for binary tree cursor semantics.
* Make docs more coherent. If we're using doxygen for API documentation, don't
  duplicate that information via quickbook!
* Include examples output (requires some Jamfile tweaking)!
* Add a tree visualisation of the documentation structure (as some kind of frontispiece)
  to the docs!
* Add FAQ
  * How can I visualise a tree, eg as SVG image?
* Take a look at BGL docs; they seem to be really well structured and written.
* Add some illustrations (also for mapping how concepts relate to each other)
* Overview: develop hierarchy/cursor concept step by step, using illustrations that 
  depict what is introduced at what step (nodes with pointers to their siblings, children, parents,
  a frame around a given cursor [and possibly additionally required information stated]
  that signifies what amount of information is contained within that cursor.

Further applications:

* Implement associative containers and priority_queue specialization using searcher
* Implement (binary) heap
* Is it possible to implement BGL's traversal algorithms using tree semantics?
* Trie
