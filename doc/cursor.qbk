[section Cursors]
[section Overview]
Cursors provide traversal and access mechanisms for navigation within a 
[link boost_tree.concepts.hierarchy Hierarchy].
Regarding their role and significance, cursors are to hierarchies what iterators are to established, 
one-dimensional STL containers. 
In fact, the Cursor concept is a refinement of the Iterator concept, or, more precisely, there is a
Cursor concept corresponding to each of the existing [@http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Iterators.html Iterator]
concepts. 
Functionally, incrementing a cursor yields the next sibling of a given parent node's 
(immediate) child (with corresponding results for decrementing and advancing operations, if present).

Due to a tree's recursive, two-dimensional nature, and with iterators already catering for a given parent 
node's child traversal, there still needs to be the aspect of vertical traversal accounted for;
and as knowing the first and last child of a parent node is the natural complement to the "iterator"
part outlined above, a Cursor is also a refinement of a [@http://www.boost.org/libs/range/index.html 
Range] (it's not a Container because it doesn't own its children -- otherwise destroying a Cursor would 
cause its immediate children, and, by recursive consequence, all its descendants to be destroyed as well).

This design allows cursors to decouple their value (yielded by a dereference operation)

[caution We still need `max_size()`; what about `swap()`, `iter_swap()`?]
[caution `parity(a)`: linear in `parent(a)`'s children, O(1) for random access?]

[caution Modification of empty() semantics... (valid for all types of tree?)]

[caution Reverse cursors conceal `end()` (as `rbegin()` points actually to the last element, not
one position behind, which is required for Multiway search to work.]

Each row in the following table lists types, that, whenever present, are defined to be identical (the 
ones in the latter two columns as introduced by the respective Iterator Traversal and Range Concepts):

(The `cursor_*` types are in `namespace boost::tree`)

[caution Use newly defined tags instead? How name them appropriately? `top_down` vs. `top_down_bottom_up`?
Sounds ridiculously complex. And should we give other complexity guarantees (esp. for parent)?]

[section Multiway Tree Cursors]
A Multiway Cursor does not point to a ['node], but to a ['position within a node]
(which often corresponds to a value); this difference might, at first glance and with only binary trees or 
forests in mind, seem a little forced or even inappropriate -- but it gets justified as soon as one takes 
Multiway Trees into consideration, and still offers powerful semantics when applied to binary trees.

[caution get their max_size as a ctor parameter]
