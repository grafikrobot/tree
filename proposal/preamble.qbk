[section Introduction]

This paper proposes addition of library components covering tree structures and related
concepts to the C++ Standard Library Technical Report 2. The proposal is based on work
towards a Boost tree component library.

The library strives to cover many of the relevant aspects within the vast field linked to
the notion of trees in computer science.

[endsect]

[section Motivation and Scope]

[section Why is this important?]

This proposal is motivated by the wish to establish methods of dealing with hierarchical
data structures in a manner that is similar to that of the Standard Template Library (STL)
for linear ones. That is,
it seeks to provide clear, straight-forward, versatile and comprehensive concepts, data
structures and algorithms for trees and related structures that allow efficient
implementation while not exposing implementation details.

In particular, this proposal strives to unite types of hierarchical data structures that
have historically been treated separately, although there is arguably good reason to view
their role for algorithms as different aspects of common underlying concepts. Formally,
this proposal's desired scope is covering all /rooted ordered connected acyclic graphs/.

[endsect]

[section What kinds of problems does it address, and what kinds of
programmers is it intended to support?]

Existing tree implementations as listed in the References section as well as the number
of posts on C++ related newsgroups give an evidence of very general, high interest in
tree and related data structures. Formalization of how to deal with hierarchical data
structures seems to be relevant as programmers of any level of skill working in any given
field is likely to need such a structure at one point.

[endsect]

[section Is it based on existing practice?]

No; this proposal originates in an effort to create a generic tree container component
for [@http://www.boost.org Boost] in the course of 
[@http://code.google.com/soc/2006/boost/appinfo.html?csaid=E17EA7C7C537C131
Google Summer of Code(tm) 2006], so at the time of this
writing, implementation work is still unfinished and, however inspired by and striving to
avoid past issues and such ones arising from current implementation efforts (see below)
it is, it has not been used in practice yet.

[endsect]

[section Is there a reference implementation?]

Yes; the current state is available from svn from __code_rep__.

[endsect]

[endsect] [/Motivation and Scope]

[section Impact on the Standard]

[section What does it depend on, and what depends on it?]

It depends on some standard library components, such as [^std::allocator] which is used
as the default allocator template argument at some points. Concepts like allocators or
iterators are reused and in some cases adapted.

[endsect]

[section Is it a pure extension, or does it require changes to
standard components?]

Most of the proposed library is a pure extension.

Some extensions [^<algorithm>] and some extensions to [^<iterator>] are proposed.

Additionally, while not proposed herein, it has sometimes been suggested to add a
template parameter to the STL associative containers [^set], [^multiset], [^map], and
[^multimap] (and possibly an argument to their constructors) specifying a policy for
storing elements, or, more concretely, what tree. The balancers presented in this
proposal would lend themselves to such use. Indicating what type of balanced hierarchy to
use for associative containers would create some amount of symmetry to TR1's [^unordered]
containers that allow specification of a hash functor; it is however a momentous decision
in which position to put such a parameter. The same position as for [^unordered]
containers (before the comparison functor) would require changes in existing code; making
it the last parameter (after the allocator) would allow existing code to remain
unchanged, but seems somewhat irritating when compared to [^unordered] containers.

[endsect]

[section Can it be implemented using today's compilers, or does it
require language features that will only be available as part of C++11]

It can be, and partly has been, implemented with today's compilers.

Note that it might be worthwhile to investigate if the present Container concept should
be modified so that it only covers the requirements as of paragraph 2 of section
[@#tr.hierarchy.req [tr.hierarchy.req]] of this proposal, which correspond to the current
Container concept with the exception of any expressions that implicitly assume linear
internal structure and outsource those to a "Linear Container" concept as similarly
formalized in the [@http://boost.org/libs/range/doc/range.html Boost Range concept]
([@http://boost.org/libs/range/doc/range.html]) externally to the Standard.

[endsect]

[endsect] [/Impact on the Standard]

[section Important Design Decisions]

[section Why did you choose the specific design that you did?]

One of the most important assets of the present design is the cursor concept as a
hierarchical continuation to the STL's iterator concept, and the externally defined range
concept. Among their benefits, cursors allow to handle both client data access, by
dereference, and subtree access while hiding the normally underlying node structure and
providing a uniform interface to algorithms that are thus enabled to deal with a number
of different kinds of trees. On the other hand, this abstraction achieves independence of
implementation details, such as nodes for storage in many cases, allowing the underlying
concepts to be applicable to other possible implementations as well.

[endsect]

[section What alternatives did you consider, and what are the
tradeoffs?]

[heading Trees of trees]

Trees, being recursively defined data structures, seem to somewhat lend themselves to
recursive implementation, i.e. declaring them in a way so they consist of a client value
part and a certain number of trees in turn (as e.g. in case of [link haas \[haas\]]). Such
an approach would allow for uniform treatment of the subtrees, but would duplicate
allocators and imply structure that need not be present. The tree, like existing STL
containers, should be responsible for data representation and storage.

[heading Augmentors/balancers as policies]

Inspired by [link austern \[austern\]] and [link dreizin \[dreizin\]], the original
approach undertaken when working on the reference implementation was to pass policy
template arguments to template class [^binary_tree]. While reproducing the (otherwise
unbalanced) tree/cursor interface seemed logical at first, it turned out that this was
conceptually not entirely clean, as e.g. it preferred one type of linear order, namely
inorder, over the others by putting such strong focus on inorder-invariant balancing and
its possible applications; also, balancing and augmenting metadata would inevitably have
been much more visible. It seemed more appropriate to have different balancing adaptors
and augmenting adaptors that would replicate the interface to do that work.

[endsect]

[section What are the consequences of your choices, for users and
implementors?]

As focus was put on versatility and comprehensiveness, we hope users will find this a
powerful framework that covers most important aspects of dealing with hierarchical data
structures in a rather intuitive way, once they have adapted to the notion of cursors
which, although being the interface relevant portion of the well-known node
implementation of trees, partly diverge in their usage from plain node objects.

Wherever reasonably possible, strong time complexity guarantees are given, which mostly,
while trying not to require much space overhead, demand implementations that make use of
any time and space saving techniques available (e.g. using arrays for both children of a
binary tree node, see e.g. [link austern \[austern\]]), which may partly restrict
implementors to one "proper" way of doing things.

[endsect]

[section What decisions are left up to implementors?]

Most of the requirements for the library components presented in this proposal are rather
tightly formulated in order to allow for them being both efficient and general enough. It
is however hoped that the conceptual abstraction of hierarchies and cursors may be of
general use, also allowing for more specific implementations where required (although
probably not as part of the library; ideally comparable to the role of containers and
iterators in modern C++ code).

[endsect]

[section If there are any similar libraries in use, how do their
design decisions compare to yours?]

Trees, having attracted much attention in the C++ community, are found in various
implementations and as subjects of a number of papers. Contrary to the present proposal,
practically all of them deal either with trees as used for sorted associative containers
(with logarithmic time complexity for more relevant operations, achieved by some sort of
balancing; examples are [link dreizin \[dreizin\]], [link ekman \[ekman\]] and 
[link karas \[karas\]]; plus, most current STL implementations use a red-black tree as their
associative containers' base) or with what we call "external" hierarchies in the
following (whose structure is dictated e.g. by a file system directory tree, an XML file
or an AST; see e.g. [link gottschlich \[gottschlich\]], [link haas \[haas\]], 
[link parent \[parent\]] and [link peeters \[peeters\]]), but rarely both fields of application.

Approaches as found in [link austern \[austern\]] or [link mirwaisi \[mirwaisi\]] go some
steps further and have provided valuable inspiration for this project, but still do not
formalize anything similar as the cursor-based interface in this proposal for dealing
with a tree's contents.

The [@http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/ BGL], finally, deals with graphs that are even
more general than hierarchical ones, which does not allow them to profit from specific
hierarchy properties as much as the ones presented in this proposal. Making cursors
logical extensions of iterators would probably also have been more difficult with a
BGL-based approach.

[endsect]

[endsect] [/Important Design Decisions]

[section Future Directions]

While it is hoped that the current proposal somewhat reunites balanced binary trees,
B-trees and "external" hierarchies, which should also facilitate work with some
higher-level structures (e.g. n-ary trees to implement tries), some of those higher-level
components might be an interesting feature to add to the library, such as patricia tries
or ternary search tries.
